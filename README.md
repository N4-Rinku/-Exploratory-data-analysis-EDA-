# -Exploratory-data-analysis-EDA-
The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information about vehicles in the context of a manufacturing plant.

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing vehicle-related data from 2003 to 2018, with specific emphasis on prices, vehicle types, fuel types, transmission modes, and other relevant features. the analysis includes various statistics, data cleaning, and visualization tasks using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

Key Steps and Features
Data Loading and Initial Exploration:

Load the dataset using Pandas.
Explore basic statistics like the range of years, minimum and maximum selling prices, and the total number of entries.

Data Cleaning:
Verify the presence of missing data and handle any inconsistencies.
Determine the number of unique vehicle types and analyze specific categories such as CNG vehicles, vehicles sold by individuals, and automatic vehicles.

Statistical Analysis:
Calculate and display various statistics, such as the lowest and highest prices for which vehicles were sold.
Determine the distribution of vehicles by fuel type, seller type, and transmission mode.

Visualization:
Use Matplotlib to create time series plots showing the number of vehicles manufactured after 2014.
Employ Seaborn for more advanced visualizations, including scatter plots, line plots, box plots, violin plots, and more, to understand the relationships between different variables.
Graphical Representations:

Generate various types of plots to visualize the distribution of selling prices, year-wise trends, and other important factors.
Use scatter plots to explore the relationship between selling price and vehicle manufacturing year.
Create histograms, box plots, and violin plots to analyze the spread and skewness of the data.
Conclusion
The project utilizes the power of Python's data analysis and visualization libraries to perform comprehensive EDA on the vehicle dataset. The insights gained from this analysis could help in understanding trends in vehicle manufacturing, pricing, and other factors, which are crucial for decision-making in manufacturing plants.
